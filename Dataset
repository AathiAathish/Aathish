1. Recommended Dataset Sources
If you don't already have a dataset, here are a few publicly available options:

Telco Customer Churn Dataset (Kaggle)
A well-known dataset from a telecom company including customer demographics, services subscribed, account info, and churn status.

IBM Telco Customer Churn Dataset (on IBM's site)
Similar to the Kaggle version, often used for classification tutorials.

UCI Machine Learning Repository – Customer Churn Datasets
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ – search for “churn.”

Would you like me to fetch one of these datasets for you?

2. Features to Analyze
Common features to predict churn include:

Customer demographics (age, gender, location)

Subscription details (services used, contract type)

Billing information (monthly charges, total charges, payment method)

Customer behavior (usage patterns, number of complaints)

Tenure (how long they've been a customer)

3. ML Techniques for Churn Prediction
Logistic Regression

Decision Trees / Random Forest

XGBoost / LightGBM

Neural Networks

Clustering for segmentation + classification

4. Typical Workflow
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Feature Engineering

Model Training and Evaluation

Model Interpretation (SHAP, feature importance)

Deploy / Predict on New Data
